description: 'Performance comparison against SQLAlchemy and FastCRUD'
---

We compare FluxCRUD against **SQLAlchemy** and **FastCRUD** (a popular alternative) to measure overhead and performance.

> **Environment**: SQLite (aiosqlite), Python 3.10, Linux.
> **Operations**: 1000 items.

## Results

| Operation | Implementation | Time (s) | Ops/sec | Notes |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Insert** | **FluxCRUD (Batcher)** | **0.12s** | **~8,000** | Uses `batch_writer` (Chunked Inserts) |
| | Raw SQLAlchemy (Bulk) | 0.21s | ~4,600 | `session.add_all` + `commit` |
| | FluxCRUD (Simple) | 0.76s | ~1,300 | Sequential `await repo.create()` |
| | FastCRUD | 0.80s | ~1,250 | Sequential `await crud.create()` |
| | | | | |
| **Read** | Raw SQLAlchemy | 0.27s | ~3,700 | Baseline |
| | **FluxCRUD (Direct)** | **0.32s** | **~3,100** | **Fastest ORM-wrapper** (Default) |
| | FastCRUD | 0.43s | ~2,300 | |
| | FluxCRUD (Loader) | 0.50s | ~2,000 | N+1 Safe (Opt-in) |

## Analysis

### 1. High Performance Writes
FluxCRUD's **Batcher** (`repo.batch_writer`) significantly outperforms sequential inserts (~4x faster) and rivals raw bulk inserts.

### 2. Read Performance
FluxCRUD is now **Fast by Default**. Use `Repository(..., use_loader=False)` (default) for maximum speed.
1.  **Direct Read**: By bypassing the DataLoader and inlining operations, FluxCRUD is **~35% faster** than FastCRUD.
2.  **Safety Option**: You can opt-in to `use_loader=True` for complex graph queries. This adds overhead (~50% slower than direct) but prevents N+1 issues automatically.
3.  **Low Overhead**: FluxCRUD adds minimal overhead (~0.05s per 1000 items) over raw SQLAlchemy.

### 3. Developer Experience
*   **FluxCRUD** provides the `Batcher` out-of-the-box for high-throughput jobs.
*   **FastCRUD** and **FluxCRUD** have similar performance for basic sequential operations, but FluxCRUD offers more robust tools (Caching, Batching) for scaling.
