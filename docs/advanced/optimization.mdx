## Query Analyzer

FluxCRUD includes a `QueryAnalyzer` to help you spot performance bottlenecks such as N+1 problems or excessive row scans.

```python
from fluxcrud.query import QueryAnalyzer

async with QueryAnalyzer() as analyzer:
    users = await repo.get_multi()

print(f"Total Queries: {analyzer.count}")
```

## SQL Hints

Sometimes you need to force a specific index or optimization hint to the database engine.

```python
from fluxcrud.query import with_hints

# Apply hints
query = with_hints(query, "MAX_EXECUTION_TIME(1000)")
```
